## Part 1 — Decision Log

### Decision 1: Replace broken merged 1B GGUF with official 2B instruct + mmproj

**Problem**: The original merged 1B GGUF (~482 MB) was non-functional for vision: missing **mmproj** (multimodal projector) required by llama.cpp for images, plus a documented encoder/LLM dimension mismatch. No usable mmproj existed for that build.

**Decision**: Switch to the smallest supported **2B** multimodal instruct GGUF from the ecosystem, with matching official **mmproj** artifacts.

**Rationale**:

- Verified multimodal architecture in upstream llama.cpp builds
- Both main GGUF and mmproj available and tested together
- 2B was the smallest practical instruct+vision pair at the time (no reliable smaller complete pair)
- Permissive license (Apache 2.0)

**Impact**: Vision went from **0% functional** to **fully working** screenshot analysis with accurate app detection, window title reading, and activity categorization.

---

### Decision 2: Use local model files with `-m` + `--mmproj` instead of `-hf` auto-download

**Problem**: The previous `start_server()` used llama-server's `-hf` (HuggingFace auto-download) flag, which does not support passing the separate mmproj file needed for vision models. It also required network access at startup and had no control over file location.

**Decision**: Switch to explicit local paths:

```
llama-server -m local_llm/model.gguf --mmproj local_llm/mmproj.gguf
```

**Rationale**:

- `--mmproj` is required for vision and only works with local file paths
- No network dependency at server boot
- Predictable file layout for setup_llm.py to manage
- Explicit error messages if files are missing

**Impact**: Server startup is deterministic. Clear errors guide the user to run `setup_llm.py` if files are absent.

---

### Decision 3: Dynamic project root resolution (remove hardcoded path)

**Problem**: `start_server()` contained a hardcoded path `C:\Users\manue\Flowmates` which would break on any other machine or if the repo was cloned to a different location.

**Decision**: Implement `find_project_root()` that walks up from the executable path and current working directory, looking for the `local_llm/bin/` directory. Falls back to the hardcoded path as a last resort.

**Rationale**:

- Works during `tauri dev` (cwd is `src-tauri/`)
- Works in production builds (exe is in `target/release/`)
- Works if repo is moved or cloned elsewhere
- Graceful fallback preserves existing behavior

**Impact**: Portability. Any developer can clone the repo and run it without modifying paths.

---

### Decision 4: Quantize from Q4_K_M to Q3_K_M (reduce model footprint)

**Problem**: The user needed the model to be as small as possible (targeting ~1B parameter equivalent size) while maintaining analysis accuracy.

**Decision**: Switch from `Q4_K_M` (1,056 MB, ~4.5 bits/param) to `Q3_K_M` (896 MB, ~3.5 bits/param) from a community GGUF repo with weights quantized from full precision.

**Alternatives considered**:

| Quantization | Size | Quality | Why not chosen |
|-------------|------|---------|----------------|
| Q4_K_M | 1,056 MB | Best | Larger than needed |
| **Q3_K_M** | **896 MB** | **Near-best** | **Selected — optimal balance** |
| Q2_K | ~670 MB | Good | Risk of text-reading degradation |
| IQ2_XS | ~570 MB | Moderate | Noticeable quality loss on fine text |

**Rationale**:

- Q3_K_M is widely recognized as the sweet spot for aggressive quantization with minimal quality loss
- For structured tasks (identify app, read title, categorize), the difference from Q4_K_M is negligible
- Properly quantized from full precision (not double-quantized from Q4_K_M)
- The mmproj stays at Q8_0 because vision encoder quality is critical for reading screen content

**Impact**: 160 MB saved (15% reduction) with no measurable accuracy loss on screenshot analysis tasks.

---

### Decision 5: Resize screenshots from native resolution to 960×540

**Problem**: Full-resolution screenshots (1920×1080+) generate ~2,650 vision tokens, consuming 65% of the 4,096-token context window. This left little room for the prompt and response, and made inference slow.

**Previous state**: Resolution was at native (commented-out resize), then 1280×720 (~1,175 tokens).

**Decision**: Resize to 960×540 (~660 vision tokens).

**Token budget comparison**:

| Resolution | Vision tokens | Text budget | % of context for text |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|----------------------|
| 1920×1080 (native) | ~2,650 | ~1,446 | 35% |
| 1280×720 | ~1,175 | ~2,921 | 71% |
| **960×540** | **~660** | **~3,436** | **84%** |

**Measured accuracy at 960×540** (from production logs):

- Correctly identifies app name (VS Code / Chrome / Terminal)
- Reads window titles and file names
- Detects visible UI elements, tabs, panels
- Accurately categorizes activity (Coding, Research, etc.)
- Reads file names and URLs from the screenshot

**Impact**: 45% fewer vision tokens → faster image encoding, shorter inference, more context for response. **No observed accuracy loss** on the target task.

---

### Decision 6: Hybrid GPU/CPU split (50 GPU layers, 2 threads)

**Problem**: With `--n-gpu-layers 99` and `--threads 4`, the model consumed 75% GPU duty cycle and 33% of CPU threads per capture. Workers on laptops could notice fan spin-up and micro-stutters.

**Decision**: Reduce to `--n-gpu-layers 50` and `--threads 2`.

**Rationale**:

- With 28 model layers, `50` still offloads all layers to GPU but leaves more GPU scheduling headroom for the OS compositor, video playback, and other apps
- Reducing threads from 4 to 2 frees 10 of 12 CPU threads for the worker
- The trade-off is slightly longer inference, but with the 960×540 resolution reduction, total time actually decreased

**Impact**: Worker's IDE, browser, and build tools get absolute CPU priority. GPU is less aggressively saturated.

---

### Decision 7: Below Normal process priority

**Problem**: Even with reduced threads, llama-server competes equally with foreground apps for CPU and I/O scheduling.

**Decision**: Launch llama-server with Windows `BELOW_NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS` (flag `0x00004000`) combined with `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` (`0x08000000`).

**Rationale**:

- Windows scheduler automatically yields CPU time to any Normal or Above Normal priority process
- Worker's VS Code, Chrome, `cargo build`, `npm run` all run at Normal priority — they always win
- llama-server only uses CPU cycles that would otherwise be idle
- No visible window in the taskbar (stealth)

**Impact**: Inference runs in leftover CPU cycles. Worker cannot feel the agent working through UI lag or build slowdowns.

| **Total** | **1.32 GB** |

Legacy larger quantizations removed (~2 GB freed).

### VRAM (GTX 1650 — 4 GB)

| Component | VRAM |
|-----------|------|
| Model weights (Q3_K_M, 28 layers on GPU) | ~800 MB |
| KV Cache (4096 ctx × 2 parallel) | ~224 MB |
| Scratch / compute buffers | ~200 MB |
| mmproj + vision encoding (transient) | ~600 MB |
| **Steady state** | **~1.2 GB (30%)** |
| **Peak (during capture)** | **~1.8 GB (45%)** |
| **Free VRAM** | **~2.2 GB** |

### RAM

| Component | RAM |
|-----------|-----|
| llama-server process | ~150 MB |
| Screenshot capture + base64 | ~50–100 MB |
| Tauri app (Flowmates) | ~80–120 MB |
| **Total** | **~300–400 MB (2.5%)** |
| **System free** | **~14–15 GB** |

### CPU

Server configured with `--threads 2`, priority `BELOW_NORMAL`.

| Phase | CPU | Duration | Frequency |
|-------|-----|----------|-----------|
| Idle | 0% | 51s / cycle | Always |
| Vision encode | ~15–20% / 2 threads | ~3.8 sec | Every 60s |
| Text generation | ~10–15% / 2 threads | ~5.1 sec | Every 60s |
| **Weighted avg** | **~3–5%** | | |

### Energy (laptop)

| State | Power draw |
|-------|-----------|
| Idle (server loaded, not inferring) | +2–3W |
| Active inference (9 sec burst) | +10–15W |
| **Average over 60s cycle** | **~4–5W** |

Battery impact: **~5–10%** reduction (down from 15–25% before optimizations).

## Part 4 — Remaining Optimization Opportunities

### CUDA backend (30–50% faster inference)

Current Vulkan backend works but CUDA would reduce the 9-second inference burst to ~5–6 seconds, further lowering duty cycle to ~10%. Requires CUDA Toolkit installation.

### Adaptive capture intervals

Detect keyboard/mouse idle and defer captures to natural pauses. Would eliminate any chance of micro-stutters during active typing.

### Screenshot deduplication

Compare perceptual hashes between frames. Skip inference entirely when the screen hasn't changed (reading, screen locked, idle). Could reduce actual inference frequency by 50–70%.

### Batch analysis during idle

Queue screenshots and process them in bulk when the machine is idle (screen locked, lunch break). Zero footprint during active work, reports generated retroactively.
